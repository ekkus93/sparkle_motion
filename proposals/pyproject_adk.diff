 # Notes / install guidance:
 # - Do NOT apply these changes to `pyproject.toml` until you approve this proposal.
 # - Platform-specific wheels (torch) must be chosen per CI/host (cpu vs cuda). Recommend documenting exact CUDA toolkit compat (e.g., cu118/cu120) in the final proposal.
 # - Wan2.1 currently distributes via a community repo; we recommend installing it from the Wan-Video GitHub repo as an editable dependency or packaging a thin adapter that pins a tested commit.
 # - Consider adding an extras group `adk-runtime-gpu` that pins CUDA-specific wheels for reproducible developer installs.
